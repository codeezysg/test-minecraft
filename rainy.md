# Parrot Rain

## Welcome to Codeezy's Parrot Rain Code Tutorial!
In this activity, you will learn key programming concepts such as **Loops**, **Sequences**, and **Events**!

Have fun!

## Step 1: Start the Chat Command
We’ll begin by creating a chat command that triggers our Parrot Rain!  

Drag out the block **on chat command** and rename it to **"parrotrain"**

```blocks
player.onChat("parrotrain", function () {
})

## Step 2: Add a "Spawn" Block

Drag out the block **spawn animal** and look for parrots!

## Step 3: Make your parrot spawn from the sky!

Amend the second 0 in the spawn block to 10!

## Step 4: Test your code!

It is important to test out your code at different iterations to ensure that you are on the right track!

## Step 5: Let's spawn a lot of parrots from the sky!

Put a repeat block in between the spawn block and repeat 100 times!

## Step 6: Test your code!

You have successfully completed the Parrot Rain activity!
